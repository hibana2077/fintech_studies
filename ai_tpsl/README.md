# AI TPSL

This repository is dedicated to the research of using machine learning to establish optimized stop-loss and take-profit strategies. The objective is to leverage the predictive capabilities of artificial algorithms to make informed decisions regarding the positioning of stop-loss and take-profit orders in trading.

Machine learning algorithms analyze vast quantities of data to recognize patterns and make forecasts. Here, we use this approach to identify when it's advantageous to close a position to either secure profits (take-profit) or prevent further losses (stop-loss).

By examining historical market data and incorporating various factors such as price volatility, market trends, and other economic indicators, the project aims to provide an enhanced, data-driven approach to decision-making in trading. The end goal is to increase overall profitability and reduce potential risks in the volatile financial market.

This repository will contain source code, datasets, model training and evaluation scripts, and various tools necessary to run and evaluate these machine learning models. Furthermore, it will serve as a hub for collaboration, where contributors can share their insights, propose improvements, and collectively advance the understanding and effectiveness of using machine learning in financial trading.

## Introduction :rocket:

This repository, AI TPSL, represents an academic endeavor into the application of machine learning, specifically Reinforcement Learning (RL), to optimize stop-loss and take-profit strategies within the domain of financial trading.

The underpinning RL model assimilates vast datasets of market behavior, continuously improving its predictive capabilities through iterative learning cycles. This machine learning approach moves beyond heuristic strategies, offering a robust and nuanced understanding of volatile trading environments.

By automating and optimizing trade decision-making processes, the objective of this research is to enhance both risk management tactics and profitability potential. This initiative provides a significant contribution to the literature and practice at the intersection of artificial intelligence and financial trading.
