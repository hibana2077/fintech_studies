# Optimizing Stock Trade Exit Strategies: An Integrated Approach using Supervised and Reinforcement Learning

## Abstract

In this study, we introduce a novel, two-phased approach that integrates supervised and reinforcement learning for optimizing stock trade exit strategies. In the initial phase, supervised learning is used to predict the percentage difference between the optimal exit points and the opening price for each trade. Subsequently, the same model is fine-tuned in a reinforcement learning environment for further optimization. This approach is innovative in two major ways:

1. Instead of performing traditional manual pre-processing on the data, we incorporate a batch normalization layer in the first layer of the model, reducing potential human bias.

2. The training is conducted in a segmented manner, with supervised learning being used to initially train on manually labeled data, followed by further optimization in a reinforcement learning environment.

We validate our methodology using cryptocurrency price data, specifically the BTCUSDT pair from the Binance futures market. The results from our experiments demonstrate that our innovative, integrated approach outperforms traditional exit strategies, yielding superior returns.
